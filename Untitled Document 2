intellectuall disablity diagnosis
 
three criteria must be met for a diagnosis of intellectual disability: significant limitation in general mental abilities (intellectual functioning), significant limitations in one or more areas of adaptive behavior across multiple environments (as measured by an adaptive behavior rating scale, i.e. communication, self-help skills, interpersonal skills, and more), and evidence that the limitations became apparent in childhood or adolescence. In general, people with intellectual disability have an IQ below 70, but clinical discretion may be necessary for individuals who have a somewhat higher IQ but severe impairment in adaptive functioning

2.Limitations in more than one area

Adaptive behavior, or adaptive functioning,

3.Certain skills are important to adaptive behavior, such as:

   3.1 Daily living skills, such as getting dressed, using the bathroom, and feeding oneself
    3.2 Communication skills, such as understanding what is said and being able to answer
    3.4 Social skills with peers, family members, spouses, adults, and others
